I am answering question 1 (Find Duplicate). I tried to come up with two different approaches to the problem, and wrote two functions that each find the 
duplicate integer in a list of integers. I wasn't completely sure about the length of the input list, so I also accounted for a couple edge cases such as an 
empty list or a list of length 1.
